This program  relies on <a href="https://exiftool.org/">ExifTool</a>.

ExifTool program is used for reading, writing and manipulating metadata in various file formats.
Exif Viewer allow the users to choose a file and then by using ExifTool the metadata of the file is displayed in a neat html format. Exif Viewer also allow to save the metadata as text, html or csv.

## Install ExifTool
This program was built to be used on windows so we will need to download the windows version of exiftool.
Navigate to <a href="https://exiftool.org/">ExifTool</a> homepage and download the `Windows Executable` zip folder. 
Inside the zip folder usally there is a exe file name `exiftool(-k)` change the name of this exe file to `exiftool`.
This is the ExifTool executable and we will need a copy of that in our project directory.

## How to use the program
After you have downloaded ExifTool its time to clone this repo.

```console
git clone
```
Go to where ever you cloned this repo on your system and find the file `run.py` and paste next to him a copy of `exiftool.exe`.
Now your project directory should look something like that:
```
exif-view üìÅ
    componets üìÅ
    icons     üìÅ
    run.py
    exiftool.exe
```
Lets continue and create a virtual environment, activate it and `pip install PySide6`.

```console
python -m venv exif_venv
exif_venv\Scripts\activate
pip install PySide6 #6.6.2
```
Now with an active venv we can run the file `run.py`.
```consle
cd exif-view
python run.py
```
You can also call the program with one additional parameter that represent a file path that you want to view his metadata and the program will display it on the gui when it will be launched.
If you add a file path when running the file it is recommended to use the file full path.

```console
python run.py c:\A\FileSome\where\On\The\System\file.txt
python run.py c:/A/FileSome/where/On/The/System/file.html
```
